# Data

As noted previously, the data for this project was drawn from the webpage of the Murder Accountability Project (https://www.murderdata.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to cataloging unsolved homicide cases in the United States of America. The data can also be downloaded in its raw form above. Note that the file is quite large (i.e., 320 mb) as there are roughly 900,000 observations.
