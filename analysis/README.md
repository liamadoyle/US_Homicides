# Analysis

Above, I have attached both the .qmd (i.e., Quarto document) and .html files for the analyses conducted for this project. For those who have R and RStudio installed, the .qmd file can be examined to reproduce the analyses performed in the project. Otherwise, the .html file can be opened in any web browser to examine the code and output for the project.
