# Data

As noted previously, the data for this project was drawn from the webpage of the Murder Accountability Project (https://www.murderdata.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to cataloging unsolved homicide cases in the United States of America. The file used for this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0iit58hu7dcwzc0ecpz2i/SHR65_23.csv?rlkey=gad3m6vkqt23iezl2sxny3euo&st=pug1groy&dl=1) alongside a [data dictionary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lo6tgo8nnbpqeru/MAPdefinitionsSHR.pdf?dl=1) provided by MAP.
